"A little while ago the task of calculating lunar phases came to mind. After investigating the various algorithms out there, I collected together this little bunch, (mainly wrapped inside complete 'show all the phases for a year' programs), and hacked them about a bit to work nicely with Javascript . They are presented here for your edification, delight and ripping off."
